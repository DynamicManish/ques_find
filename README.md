# ques_find
Heya, This is a question finder made in Python scripts

It is basically made for increasing the understanding of making advanced programs with simple statements. 
This is a 'question_finder', what it will do is that It will take inputs, will check if it is an interrogative user_input, will make it capitalized case, and will arrange it in the form of a sentence.
